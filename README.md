## Overview

I expected this app to be an easy breeze through, because I already pictured the entire project structure in my head. I couldn't be any more wrong. It started gracefully until I started running into nasty bugs, especially since this was my first time using the formidable library. I spent days debugging. At some point, I began to think JavaScript was self-aware. Because I'd close my laptop, having written a perfectly working code. Only to wake up to bugs in the morning. It was so annoying but I learned alot on the task. My ability to work under frustration was really tested.

You can find the demo videos of the project (including a walkthrough of the back end code, database strucure, deployment process at <a href="https://files.fm/u/hm9npeqmj">Demo</a>. I hope you like it.
